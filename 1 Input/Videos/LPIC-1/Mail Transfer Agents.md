MTA receives and sends mails in system. If it within he system, it will put it to, for example, `/var/pool/jadi/mails`, but if it third party mail like gmail, it will contact to their server.
Now sending other servers is not working due to security reasons.

We have different options of MTA: `sendmail` - oldest, not secure;  `exim` - flexible one; `postfix` - newest one, default now.

You can download `postfix` and `mail` or `bsd-mailx` and play with it. Command is `mail`.
