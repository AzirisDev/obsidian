Take a look at that video. Here we can get the info about backup system over all digital information you have.

There is golden rule of 3 in backup the system.
```
Keep 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of storage, with 1 copy stored offsite.
```

Here’s what each part means:
1. 🧩 **3 Copies of Data**
    - You should have **at least three copies**:
        - **1 primary (working)** copy — the one you actively use.
        - **2 backup** copies — to protect against data loss.
    - Example: your laptop files, a local external hard drive backup, and a cloud backup.
2. 💾 **2 Different Storage Media**
    - Store the backups on **two different types of storage** to avoid single points of failure.
    - Example: one copy on a **local SSD/NAS** and another on **cloud storage** or **tape**.
    - This ensures that if one medium fails (say, your SSD), another independent medium still holds the data.
3. ☁️ **1 Offsite Copy**
    - Keep at least **one copy in a separate physical location** — away from your main system.
    - This protects against fire, theft, flood, or other local disasters.
    - Example: a cloud backup (e.g., Backblaze, AWS S3, Google Drive) or a physical drive stored elsewhere.

Here is the implementation with `Synology`. Check it out later.
