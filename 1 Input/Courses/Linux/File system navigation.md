When you first look at Linux, the filesystem may feel like wandering in a city without street signs.

But once you know theÂ **important directories**, the city starts making sense:

âœ…Â `/home`Â â†’ personal space for each user.  
âœ…Â `/root`Â â†’ the home of the root user.  
âœ…Â `/bin`Â andÂ `/sbin`Â â†’ essential binaries, for users and for system administration.  
âœ…Â `/proc`Â â†’ runtime info about processes.  
âœ…Â `/dev`Â â†’ device files, a bridge to hardware.  
âœ…Â `/etc`Â â†’ system configuration, edited only by root.  
âœ…Â `/var`Â â†’ logs and variable data that constantly change.  
âœ…Â `/boot`Â â†’ files needed to start the system.  
âœ…Â `/lib`Â â†’ shared libraries for programs.

For removable media, Linux uses:
1. `/run`Â â†’ current mount points for USBs and CDs.
2. `/mnt`Â â†’ temporary mount points.

And when working with files, a few commands become your best friends:

- `diff`Â â†’ compare files.
- `patch`Â â†’ apply updates from a patch file.
- `file`Â â†’ identify what kind of file youâ€™re dealing with.
- `cp`Â â†’ copy files or directories.
- `rsync`Â â†’ advanced syncing, locally or over the network.

Example:  
`rsync -avz --delete /user/docs /backup/docs`  
This syncs your documents, compresses them, preserves permissions, and keeps the backup clean.

Linux may look complex, but once you know where things live and how to move them, it becomes a system you can truly master.
