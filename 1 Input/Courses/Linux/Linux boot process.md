Boot process is everything that happens from first file initiations until GUI appears among users. Understanding of that process will give you broader view of system for future's sake.

We can separate boot process for several steps:
1) [[BIOS]]
2) [[Master Boot Record(MBR)]]
3) [[Boot Loader]]
4) [[Initial RAM disk]]
5) [[Kernel]]
6) [[sbin init and Services]]
