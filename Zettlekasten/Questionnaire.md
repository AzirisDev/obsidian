## **A. Flutter & Dart Fundamentals**
1. Explain the difference between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`. Give examples.
2. How does Flutter rebuild widgets? What triggers a rebuild?
3. What are `Keys` in Flutter, and when would you use `ValueKey`, `ObjectKey`, or `GlobalKey`?
4. Explain Futures, async/await, Streams, and how they differ.
5. How do you optimize Flutter app performance for scrolling lists, animations, or frequent rebuilds?    
6. What are the differences between hot reload and hot restart? How do they work internally? 
7. How does Flutter render UI on screen? Explain the widget → element → render object tree.

## **B. State Management & App Architecture**

1. What state management solutions have you used? Compare Provider, BLoC, GetX, and Riverpod. 
2. How do you decide where to store state (local widget state vs app-wide state)?
3. Explain how you would structure a medium-size Flutter project. What folders and layers would you create?
4. What is a repository or service layer? Why is it important?
5. How do you handle API calls, caching, and error handling in your apps?
6. Have you worked with modular, layered, or clean architecture? Explain the benefits.
7. How would you refactor a large `StatefulWidget` that handles multiple features?

## **C. Testing & Debugging**

1. Have you written unit, widget, or integration tests? Provide examples.
2. How do you test asynchronous code or API calls?
3. How do you debug Flutter apps? Which tools do you use?
4. How do you profile performance in Flutter? Give an example when you optimized a slow widget.
5. What is the difference between `flutter test`, `flutter drive`, and `integration_test`?

## **D. Version Control & Workflow**

1. How comfortable are you with Git (branching, merging, rebasing, cherry-pick)?
2. Have you resolved complex merge conflicts? Give an example.

---

## **E. Packages & Libraries**

1. What Flutter packages do you use frequently, and why?
2. How do you evaluate whether to use a new package or write your own solution?
3. Have you ever contributed to open-source Flutter packages?

---

## **F. UI/UX & Widgets**

1. How do you create responsive layouts for different screen sizes and orientations?
2. How do you implement animations in Flutter? Give examples.
3. What is the difference between `Expanded`, `Flexible`, and `Spacer` widgets?
4. How do you handle theming and dark mode in a Flutter app?

---

## **G. Soft Skills / Learning Mindset**

1. How do you approach learning a new Flutter feature or Dart concept?
2. How do you debug a bug you don’t immediately understand?
3. How do you handle code reviews? How do you give and receive feedback?
4. How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple features?
5. Have you ever taught someone else a Flutter concept? How did you approach it?

---

## **H. Conceptual Questions**

1. Explain `InheritedWidget` and when you would use it.
2. What is the difference between hot reload, setState, and rebuilding with Provider/BLoC?
3. How do you handle platform-specific code in Flutter (MethodChannels, plugins)?
4. Explain how Flutter handles gestures and the event pipeline.
5. How would you design a Flutter app that must work offline first, sync data when online, and handle conflicts?
