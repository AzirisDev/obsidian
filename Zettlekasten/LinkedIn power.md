LinkedIn is de facto way of sharing professional experience.
Your profile will do passive job search, even if it is not necessary now. You can get connections with recruiters and other specialists for the sake of the future.

What to do:
- Build network first - over 500 connections
- Post 2 to 5 times a week
- Post on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday
- Post between 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM
- Aim 5 meaningful comments a day
- [[Make posts authentic and effective]]
