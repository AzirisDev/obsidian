Internet Protocol addresses are necessary to route the information packets. Packets contain data and headers with source, destination and other information.

### IPv4
Older version of IP, uses 32 bits -> 4.3 billion unique addresses. Contains 4 octets - 8 bit sections. 

It is divided to 5 classes - A, B, C, D, E. First three is commonly used for networks and hosts.

- A class - first octet, 1.0.0.0 -> 127.255.255.255, 126 networks to 16.7 million hosts
- B class - first two octets, 128.0.0.0 -> 191.255.255.255, 16384 networks to 65536 hosts
- C class - first three octets, 192.0.0.0 -> 223.255.255.255, 2,1 million networks to 256 hosts

IP address can be assigned manually or by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) dynamically.

### IPv6
Newer version of IP, uses 128 bits -> 3.4 * 10^38 unique addresses. 

NAT - Network Address Translation - expands IPv4 address to share one external IP address in home.
