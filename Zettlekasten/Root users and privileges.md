Root user is admin user, it has all permissions.
It is not recommended to grant other users with that level of access.

- su - switch user - is not recommended to use, but it gives one time opportunity to run command.
- sudo - it assigns temporary root access to other user.

sudo configurations are stored in /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/ directories.
