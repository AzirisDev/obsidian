You can view them using "set", "env", "export". 
"export" also gives opportunity to sub-shells, child processes to use those variables.

- HOME - user's home directory
- PATH - ordered list of directories configured to find executable programs
- SHELL - points to default shell
- PS1 - configures the appearance of command line prompt
