Sysfs is a pseudo file system that provides information about hardware, devices, subtypes, drivers. It is mounted at /sys directory.

It has several important parts: 
- /udev - user/dev - device manager for the Linux kernel: hard drives, flash drives. We can read and write to it, even write scripts to start some backup, etc
- /dbus - message bus system, which helps applications to share messages and information; coordinates process lifecycle
- /proc - Kernel keeps there settings and properties: processes, system control(webcam on/off), network settings, I/O ports
