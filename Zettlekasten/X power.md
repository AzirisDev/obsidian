Tweet everyday what you did today.
Keep it simple, you are anyways limited by character length per tweet.
It can be anything: new command line, new trend, technology, bug.

The key is consistency.

Experiment: analyze your tweets by "from: username min_faves: 5 and within_time:7d"
You try tweet more about most resonating thoughts/topics.
