here is my promt to generate images:

`Generate me a picture of Linux Penguin. Image should not contain any words. Image should in Rick and Morty style of animation. Give a penguin cool, scientific look. No background, choose some one color(maybe little gradient) background, with eye catching color. Also, do not forget that this will be posted on LinkedIn`
