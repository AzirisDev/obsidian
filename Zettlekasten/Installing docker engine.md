The magic of linux is that we can run docker container natively. We do not need to download Docker Desktop or etc. It is because on Linux containers can run immediately on the kernel that is shared here, while others run vm and run containers in it.

You need these two commands from the link:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

run to check:

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```


go to 'convenience script'
