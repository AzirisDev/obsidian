I felt like a complete fraud for 4 straight days this week.

After nailing the hard parts of my Arch Linux setup (encryption, bootloader), I got stuck on something "simple." My package manager kept failing during window manager - Hyprland setup. I was absolutely convinced it was a deep, complex mirrorlist issue or something else.

The frustration was immense. I almost gave up.

Then, the most humbling thought crossed my mind - "Wait, do I even have internet connection?"
After hours of complex debugging, my "fix" looked like this: 
✅ Ran a simple `ping` command. Nothing. 
✅ Checked my hardware status with `rfkill list`. My WiFi was soft-blocked. 🤦‍♂️ 
✅ Typed `rfkill unblock all`. Everything instantly worked.

I was too proud to check if I was even connected to the internet. It was a powerful, embarrassing reminder that ego is the biggest bug.

What's a "stupid" mistake that taught you a valuable lesson? I'd love to hear your facepalm moments below. 👇
