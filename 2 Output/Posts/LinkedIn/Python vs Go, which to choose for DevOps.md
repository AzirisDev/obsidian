Lately I’ve been thinking about which language to focus on for DevOps — Python or Go.

I’m diving into Python right now, and it’s fun — all those scripts, automation tricks, and cloud tasks make you feel like a wizard.

But then I remember a few years ago, I went through the Go tour. That language is good. Clean syntax, crazy fast, and my friend who’s a Go backend dev keeps telling me, “It’s insane what you can do with this.”

I kinda get why Python is everywhere in DevOps — huge ecosystem, tons of libraries, simple to pick up. But still… I wonder, what do other DevOps folks actually use day-to-day?

Do you go for Go when speed matters, or Python for flexibility? I’d love to hear how you decide 👇
