Every DevOps engineer eventually faces the same question: "How do I manage processes efficiently in Linux?"

Linux gives us powerful commands and concepts to keep processes under control. Here are essentials every professional should know:
âœ… Priority withÂ `nice`Â values, from -20 (highest) to 19 (lowest).  
âœ… Adjust priorities usingÂ `renice`, root can increase priority.  
âœ… Monitor withÂ `ps`,Â `top`,Â `uptime`,Â `pstree`, or GUI tools like gnome-system-monitor.  
âœ… Kill processes with signals:
- `kill -9 PID`Â forcefully.
- `kill -15 PID`Â politely.
- `killall`Â signals all processes.

Foreground and background management:
âœ…Â `ctrl + c`Â end foreground.  
âœ…Â `ctrl + z`Â suspend foreground.  
âœ…Â `command &`Â run in background.  
âœ…Â `fg`Â orÂ `bg`Â to switch jobs.  
âœ…Â `nohup`Â to detach process from shell.

Scheduling tools:
âœ…Â `sleep`Â for delays.  
âœ…Â `at`Â for one-time scheduling.  
âœ…Â `cron`Â for recurring tasks via crontab.

Load average is another key metric, showing system stress. A value of 1 means full utilization of one CPU core. Divide load average by number of cores for real insight.
