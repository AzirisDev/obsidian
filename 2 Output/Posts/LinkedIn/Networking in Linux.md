Before you can master DevOps, you need to understand one invisible thing: **the network**.  
It’s how every server, container, and service _talks_ to each other.

Here’s the big picture every engineer should know 👇

✅ **What a network really is**  
It’s a group of devices that share data through cables or signals.  
The internet is just the biggest one — billions of machines exchanging tiny packets of information every second.

✅ **How those packets find their way**  
Each packet has a source, destination, and payload.  
IP addresses (like 192.168.0.1) make sure every message reaches the right place.  
Think of it as the home address of your data.

✅ **IPv4 vs IPv6**  
IPv4 (32-bit) gave us about 4.3 billion addresses.  
We used them all, so IPv6 (128-bit) was born — enough for _every grain of sand_ to have its own address.

✅ **DNS — the phonebook of the internet**  
You don’t remember IPs, you remember names.  
DNS converts google dot com into its real address.  
Before that happens, Linux checks `/etc/hosts` first — your system’s own little directory.

Once you see the network as a system of conversations,  
you stop treating it like magic and start _debugging like an engineer_.
