The falcon doesn’t chase everything that moves.  
It waits, high above the chaos, scanning patterns that others can’t see.
Once you move beyond `cat` and `grep`, text becomes data, and every command is a transformation tool.

Here are the advanced ones that separate beginners from real engineers 👇

✅ **sed** — the stream editor.  
`sed 's/old/new/g' file` instantly replaces text patterns.  
Use it for cleanup, bulk edits, or log fixes without ever opening the file.

✅ **awk** — the field-aware data extractor.  
`awk -F, '{print $2}' file.csv` fetches specific columns.  
It’s perfect for quick reporting, parsing logs, or scripting one-liners.

✅ **paste & join** — combine multiple files line by line.  
`paste file1 file2` merges side by side.  
`join file1 file2` links data with common fields, like SQL joins but simpler.

✅ **split & cut & tr** — break, extract, and transform.  
`split file big_` divides large files into manageable chunks.  
`cut -f3 file` pulls specific columns.  
`tr a-z A-Z` converts text to uppercase in seconds.

Once you master these, you stop “editing files” and start _shaping data_.
