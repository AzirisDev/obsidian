Ever wondered what really happens between pressing the power button and seeing your Linux login screen?

Most developers never look under the hood â€” but understanding the boot process gives you deep insight into how Linux actuallyÂ _comes alive_.

Hereâ€™s the simplified breakdown of the Linux boot process:
1. **Firmware (BIOS/UEFI)**Â performs a Power-On Self Test and initializes hardware.
2. **Boot Loader (GRUB)**Â starts up minimal hardware and loads the Linux kernel.
3. **Kernel**Â initializes drivers and mounts the initial file system usingÂ `initramfs`.
4. **Init system**Â (likeÂ `systemd`) launches essential processes such as networking and servers.

Some useful insights:

âœ… You can pass kernel parameters directly via GRUB configs.  
âœ… UseÂ `dmesg`Â orÂ `journalctl -k`Â to read kernel logs.  
âœ… Boot logs are saved inÂ `/var/log/dmesg`Â andÂ `/var/log/boot.log`.

Next time your system misbehaves during startup, youâ€™ll knowÂ _exactly_Â where to look.

How deep have you gone in exploring your systemâ€™s boot process? Have you ever fixed a startup issue manually? Iâ€™d love to hear your story ðŸ‘‡
