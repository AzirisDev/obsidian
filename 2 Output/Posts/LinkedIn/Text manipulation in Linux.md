When I first started with Linux, I underestimated how powerful text manipulation could be.  
Turns out, mastering just a few commands makes you unstoppable in DevOps work.

Here are the ones that every engineer should know ðŸ‘‡

âœ…Â **cat & tac**Â â€” view or concatenate files (andÂ `tac`Â reverses them).  
`cat file1 file2 > newfile`Â combines files.  
`cat >> file`Â lets you append text until you hit Ctrl+D.

âœ…Â **less, head, tail**Â â€” handle large files efficiently.  
`less file`Â to scroll without loading it fully.  
`head -5 file`Â for the first 5 lines.  
`tail -f logfile`Â to monitor live logs like a pro.

âœ…Â **sort & uniq**Â â€” clean and organize data.  
`sort file`Â orders content,Â `sort -r`Â reverses it.  
`sort -u`Â removes duplicates instantly.

âœ…Â **grep & wc**Â â€” your daily search and count duo.  
`grep pattern file`Â finds what matters.  
`wc -l file`Â tells you exactly how many lines.

Master these, and youâ€™ll never open a 2GB log file the wrong way again.

Which of these commands do you use most in your daily workflow? Iâ€™d love to hear your go-to combo ðŸ‘‡
