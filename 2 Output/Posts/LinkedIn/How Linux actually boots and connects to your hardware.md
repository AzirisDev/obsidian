Ever wondered how your operating systemÂ actually orchestratesÂ hardware and software?

Hereâ€™s what really happens when your computer starts ðŸ‘‡

âœ…Â **Hardware first**Â â€” motherboard, RAM, drives â€” pure resources waiting to be managed.  
âœ…Â **Firmware next**Â â€” tiny softwareÂ _on_Â the hardware that ensures it runs properly.  
âœ… Then comesÂ **the boot process:**
1. **BIOS**: Old-school, text-based, boots from the Master Boot Record.
2. **UEFI**: Modern, flexible, uses a FAT partition atÂ `/boot/efi`.

Once the system is booted, theÂ **kernel**Â steps in to manage all hardware communication.  
It exposes this info throughÂ **sysfs**, a pseudo filesystem mounted atÂ `/sys`.

Supporting systems make it all flow:
- `/udev`Â manages devices like drives and USBs.
- `/dbus`Â lets apps exchange system messages.
- `/proc`Â stores kernel and process details.

Understanding this bridge is the first real step to mastering Linux internals.

Have you ever exploredÂ `/sys`Â orÂ `/proc`Â to see whatâ€™s happening under the hood? ðŸ‘‡
