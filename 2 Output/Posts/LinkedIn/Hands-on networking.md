Once you understand how networks work, the next step is knowing how toÂ _see_Â andÂ _control_Â them.  
Thatâ€™s where Linux commands become your best tools.

Here are the essentials every DevOps engineer should master ðŸ‘‡

âœ…Â **Check connectivity**  
`ping hostname`Â â€” test if a system is reachable.  
`traceroute`Â â€” follow the path your packets take.  
`dig`Â orÂ `nslookup`Â â€” see how DNS resolves a domain.

âœ…Â **Inspect and configure routes**  
`ip route`Â â€” show how packets move between networks.  
`ip route add/del`Â â€” manually set or remove routes when debugging.

âœ…Â **Work with DNS and host settings**  
`/etc/resolv.conf`Â defines how DNS queries are handled.  
`/etc/hosts`Â maps local names to IPs before DNS is used.

âœ…Â **Transfer and communicate securely**  
`ssh user@IP`Â â€” log into remote servers and run commands.  
`scp source destination`Â â€” securely copy files between systems.  
`curl`Â andÂ `wget`Â â€” download or inspect web data directly from the terminal.

Once you get comfortable with these, network debugging stops feeling like guessing,  
and starts feeling likeÂ _control_.
