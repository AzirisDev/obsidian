The first time I ranÂ **`vimtutor`**, it took me more than 2 hours.

I was pausing, taking notes, and constantly looking up commands.  
On the second day, it dropped to 1.5 hours.  
Each day after that it became easier.  
Now I finish the whole tutor in just 15 minutes, almost on autopilot.

That daily practice changed how I see Vim. The commands that once felt cryptic now feel natural:

âœ…Â `:q!`Â to quit without saving,Â `:wq`Â to save and quit.  
âœ…Â `dw`Â to delete a word,Â `dd`Â to delete a line.  
âœ…Â `u`Â to undo,Â `p`Â to paste.  
âœ…Â `gg`Â to jump to the start,Â `G`Â to jump to the end.  
âœ…Â `/word`Â to search,Â `:%s/old/new/g`Â to replace across the file.

The trick is simple. RunÂ `vimtutor`Â every day. It is a built-in interactive course, and 30 minutes of practice adds up quickly.

Have you ever measured how your learning speed improves when you repeat the same exercise daily? ðŸ‘‡
