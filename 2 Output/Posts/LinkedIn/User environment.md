🔥 Most developers underestimate how much the _user environment_ defines their Linux experience.

Every command, permission, and configuration you touch starts right there.

Here’s the core you need to truly understand your Linux environment:

✅ **System vs user settings**  
System-wide configs live in `/etc`, but user-specific overrides live in `/home`.  
That’s why what you see might differ from another user on the same system.

✅ **Login vs interactive shells**  
At login, Linux checks your startup files in this order:
1. `~/.bash_profile`
2. `~/.bash_login`
3. `~/.profile`

Then, every new terminal session sources `~/.bashrc`. That’s usually where your aliases, PATH updates, and shell tweaks live.

✅ **Users and groups management**  
Linux organizes users into groups to manage shared permissions efficiently.  
You can find user and group data in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`.

Creating or removing users:
- `sudo useradd user1` (with `-m`, `-c`, or `-s` options)
- `sudo passwd user1`
- or interactively `adduser`
- remove with `sudo userdel -r user1`

For groups:
- `sudo groupadd new_group`
- `sudo groupdel new_group`
- `sudo usermod -aG new_group username` (the `-a` is crucial, it appends instead of overwriting).

✅ **Root access and sudo**  
Root is the admin user with full permissions. It’s powerful, but dangerous if misused.
- `su` switches user temporarily, but it’s not ideal.
- `sudo` grants temporary elevated access safely.

Sudo configurations live in `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/`. They define _who can do what_ at the root level.

Mastering these basics isn’t just “Linux hygiene.” It’s the foundation for any DevOps engineer who wants to truly understand how systems behave.
