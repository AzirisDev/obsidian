When people first try Vim, they think every `:e` opens a new “tab”.

But here’s the truth: Vim doesn’t work with tabs the way browsers do. It works with **buffers** — in-memory text copies of files you’re editing.

Here’s a quick practical guide that makes buffers click:
1. `:e [filename]` opens a file into a new buffer.
2. `:enew` starts a fresh, empty buffer you can later save as a new file.
3. `:bp` and `:bn` move between previous and next buffers.
4. `:bd` deletes a buffer, but doesn’t delete the file itself.
5. `:badd [filename]` just adds a buffer without switching to it.
6. `:sp [filename]` or `:vs [filename]` split the screen so you can edit files side by side.
    - Use `Ctrl+ww` to jump between splits.
7. You can even split the same file in multiple views, super useful for large files.

✅ Buffers = the real core of Vim editing.  
✅ Splits and navigation make Vim feel like a true IDE.  
✅ Tabs in Vim are more like window layouts, not file containers.

Master buffers first, and Vim stops feeling like a puzzle and starts feeling like a superpower.
