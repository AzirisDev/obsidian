Have you ever wondered how Linux actually handles files across different disks and devices?

It all comes down toÂ **partitions and mount points**.

âœ… A partition is a logical section of a physical disk. One disk can hold multiple partitions, each with its own file system.  
âœ… We create partitions to separate operating systems, organize data, or improve security.  
âœ… To access a partition, Linux uses aÂ _mount point_Â â€” a directory where that partition is attached.

Example:
1. `/dev/sda1`Â contains the OS, mounted atÂ `/`Â â†’ system files.
2. `/dev/sda2`Â is a USB drive, mounted atÂ `/mnt/usb/`Â â†’ USB content.

Useful commands:
- `sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/usb`Â â†’ mount a device.
- `sudo umount /mnt/usb`Â â†’ unmount it.
- Persistent mounts are configured inÂ `/etc/fstab`.

And it doesnâ€™t stop at local disks. WithÂ **NFS (Network File System)**, you can mount remote file systems and directly access or edit files from other machines as if they were local.

Have you ever set up custom mount points or used NFS in your projects? Iâ€™d love to hear your experience ðŸ‘‡
