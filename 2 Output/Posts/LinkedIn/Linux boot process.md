When you power on a Linux machine, a whole chain of invisible steps unfolds before you see the GUI. Most people never think about it, but knowing the boot process gives you a much clearer view of how the system actually works.

Here‚Äôs the journey, step by step:
1. **BIOS**: Initializes hardware, keyboard, and memory checks from the motherboard firmware.
2. **MBR**: A small section of disk holding the partition table and a tiny program that points to the Boot Loader.
3. **Boot Loader**: Loads the OS into RAM, lets you choose between operating systems, and starts the Kernel with an initial RAM filesystem.
4. **Initramfs**: A temporary filesystem providing essential tools and drivers until the real root filesystem is mounted.
5. **Kernel**: Configures hardware, memory, processes, and I/O subsystems.
6. **Init Services**: Traditionally¬†`/sbin/init`, now linked to¬†`systemd`, which manages startup in parallel, handles logging, and ensures dependencies load cleanly.

Understanding this flow means you‚Äôre not just ‚Äúusing Linux‚Äù, you‚Äôre seeing under the hood like a systems engineer.
