Running Docker on Linux feels like magic.  
Why? Because here, containers run directly on the Linux kernel.

On macOS or Windows, Docker needs a virtual machine first, then runs containers inside it.  
On Linux, containers speak to the kernel natively. Faster, cleaner, no middleman.

Hereâ€™s how simple it is to get Docker Engine on Ubuntu:

1. Download the official script:
    `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
2. Install Docker:
    `sudo sh get-docker.sh`
3. Test it out:
    `sudo docker run hello-world`

Thatâ€™s all it takes to unlock native container power. Full guide here:Â [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Are you running Docker directly on Linux, or do you still prefer Docker Desktop? Share your setup ðŸ‘‡
