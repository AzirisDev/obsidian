Ever wondered why every serious DevOps engineer insists on Linux?

Linux is not just another operating system. It is the foundation of modern infrastructure: open-source, flexible, and powering everything from enterprise servers to smart appliances.

Here is why learning Linux is non-negotiable for DevOps engineers:

âœ… **Market demand.** Most systems you will work on run on Linux.  
âœ… **The tools are Linux-native.** Containers are abstractions of Linux systems. Kubernetes orchestrates those containers. Whole cloud journey starts there
âœ… **Pipelines depends on it.** CI/CD systems, from GitHub Actions to GitLab, rely on Linux-based servers and file systems.

If you cannot debug or navigate Linux, you will always miss the bigger picture.
