Every Linux system is alive with processes, yet many professionals confuse processes with programs or commands.

A process is anÂ _instance_Â that consumes CPU and memory, managed directly by the kernel. Programs can spawn multiple processes, each with its own role.

Here are the main types of processes:
1. Interactive, started by the user from terminal or GUI.
2. Batch, scheduled jobs detached from the terminal.
3. Daemons, background services that run continuously.
4. Threads, lightweight processes under the main process, sharing resources.
5. Kernel threads, special system tasks with limited user control.

Each process has unique identifiers:

âœ… PID, process ID.  
âœ… PPID, parent process ID.  
âœ… TID, thread ID under a process.

Processes also move between states:

âœ… Running, actively on CPU or waiting to run.  
âœ… Waiting, paused for user input.  
âœ… Zombie, finished but not yet removed.

Schedulers decide which process runs, placing them into running or wait queues, often across multiple CPU cores.

How do you usually explain the concept of a process to newcomers learning Linux? I'd love to hear your analogy ðŸ‘‡
