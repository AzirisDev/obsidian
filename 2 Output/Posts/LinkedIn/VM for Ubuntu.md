Running Ubuntu inside a virtual machine is one of the easiest ways to practice Linux without risking your main system ðŸ“º

Here is a simple way to set it up:

1. Download and installÂ **UTM**Â for macOS orÂ **Oracle VM VirtualBox**Â for Windows.
2. Get the latestÂ **Ubuntu LTS**Â image from the official website.
3. Check theÂ **processor type**Â to ensure compatibility.
4. Allocate resources: 4â€“8 GB RAM, 2 cores, and 30â€“40 GB of storage works well.
5. Follow the installation steps and youâ€™re ready to go.
