Most peopleÂ _use_Â Linux, but few know how to actuallyÂ _inspect and manage_Â their hardware.

Hereâ€™s how to start:

âœ…Â **Essential commands to explore your system:**  
`lsusb`Â â€“ shows USB devices connected.  
`lspci`Â â€“ lists PCI components.  
`lsblk`Â â€“ displays data blocks (drives and partitions).  
`lshw`Â â€“ gives a complete hardware overview (CPU, memory, etc.).

âœ…Â **Kernel modules**Â are what make Linux modular. TheseÂ `.ko`Â files load only when needed.
- Located atÂ `/lib/modules`.
- Check whatâ€™s loaded:Â `lsmod`.
- Load or remove:Â `modprobe`Â andÂ `rmmod`.

âœ…Â **Make modules persistent**Â even after reboot:  
ReviewÂ `/etc/modules`Â andÂ `/etc/modprobe.d`Â for configuration.

Knowing this lets you diagnose issues, customize systems, and understand Linux far deeper than most.

Which of these commands do you use most for hardware debugging? ðŸ‘‡
