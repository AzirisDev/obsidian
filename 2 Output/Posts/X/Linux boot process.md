**Day 1**  
Most devs treat theÂ **Linux boot process**Â as a black box.  
But every time you hit power, a hidden sequence transforms hardware into a running system.  
Understanding it means you stop being just aÂ _user_Â and start thinking like an engineer.

**Day 2**  
Step 1 of Linux boot:Â **BIOS**.  
It wakes up the hardware, checks memory, and prepares the system for what comes next.  
The entire chain of boot steps rests on this tiny piece of firmware.

**Day 3**  
**MBR + Boot Loader**Â are the unsung heroes of Linux boot.  
ðŸ”¹ MBR stores the partition table and points to the Boot Loader.  
ðŸ”¹ Boot Loader loads the OS into RAM and hands control to the Kernel.  
Without them, your OS would never even start.

**Day 4**  
FromÂ **Initramfs â†’ Kernel â†’ systemd**:  
âœ… Initramfs loads drivers and tools.  
âœ… Kernel configures hardware and memory.  
âœ… systemd launches services and keeps dependencies in order.  
Thatâ€™s how Linux goes from bare metal to a GUI.
