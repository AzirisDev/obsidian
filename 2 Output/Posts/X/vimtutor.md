### **Day 1 — Personal Story & Hook**

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**  
The first time I ran `vimtutor`, it took me 2+ hours.  
I was pausing, taking notes, and constantly looking things up.

Now I finish it in 15 minutes on autopilot.  
Here’s what daily practice with Vim taught me 🧵

**Tweet 2**  
Progression looked like this:  
Day 1 → 2+ hours  
Day 2 → 1.5 hours  
Day 3 → under 1 hour  
Now → 15 minutes

Consistency > intensity.

By repeating `vimtutor` daily, commands that once felt impossible became second nature.  
Tomorrow, I’ll share the most essential commands every beginner should master first.

### **Day 2 — Essential Basics**

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**  
Vim basics every beginner must know (straight from `vimtutor`) 🧵

**Tweet 2**  
✅ `:q!` quit without saving  
✅ `:wq` save and quit  
✅ `i` insert mode  
✅ `o` insert mode on a new line  
✅ `x` delete character

Master these, and Vim stops being scary.  
Tomorrow, I’ll cover _deletions and motions_ — the real power move in Vim.

### **Day 3 — Deletion & Movement**

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**  
The moment Vim “clicked” for me was when I learned how deletion works. 🧵

**Tweet 2**  
It’s all about _operators + motions_:

✅ `dw` delete to start of next word  
✅ `de` delete to end of word  
✅ `d$` delete to end of line  
✅ `dd` delete entire line

**Tweet 3**  
Combine them with numbers for speed:

`d3w` → delete 3 words  
`d5e` → delete 5 words  
`10dd` → delete 10 lines

**Tweet 4**  
Motion + repetition = efficiency.  
Tomorrow, I’ll show you how Vim makes _changes and replacements_ just as powerful.

### **Day 4 — Change, Replace & Search**

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**  
Once you get comfortable deleting in Vim, the next step is _changing and replacing_. 🧵

**Tweet 2**  
✅ `rX` replace a single char with X  
✅ `ce` change to end of word  
✅ `cc` change the entire line  
✅ `c3w` change 3 words

**Tweet 3**  
Searching and replacing is equally powerful:

`/word` → search  
`n` → next match  
`:%s/old/new/g` → replace everywhere  
`:%s/old/new/gc` → replace with confirmation

**Tweet 4 (Closing)**  
Vim feels overwhelming at first.  
But daily practice with `vimtutor` breaks it down into digestible lessons.  
That’s how I went from 2 hours to 15 minutes.
