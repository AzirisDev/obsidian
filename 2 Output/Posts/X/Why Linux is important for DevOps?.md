Ever wondered why every serious DevOps engineer insists on Linux? 🐧  
It is not just another OS, it is the foundation of modern infrastructure.

🧵 Let me explain why Linux is non-negotiable for DevOps engineers:

---

**Tweet 2:**  
✅ **Market demand**  
Most of the systems you’ll work on in DevOps run on Linux. From cloud servers to enterprise apps, Linux dominates the backbone of the internet.

---

**Tweet 3:**  
✅ **The tools are Linux-native**  
Containers are just abstractions of Linux systems.  
Kubernetes orchestrates those containers.  
Your entire cloud-native journey starts with Linux.

---

**Tweet 4:**  
✅ **Pipelines depend on it**  
CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and many more run on Linux-based servers and file systems.

Without Linux knowledge, debugging pipelines feels like guesswork.

**Tweet 5:**  
If you cannot navigate or debug Linux, you’ll always miss the bigger picture.

Linux isn’t just a skill, it’s the language of modern infrastructure.
