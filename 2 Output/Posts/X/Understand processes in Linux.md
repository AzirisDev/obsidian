💡 Many confuse _programs_ with _processes_ in Linux.  
👉 A **program** is just code.  
👉 A **process** is a living instance, consuming CPU & memory, managed by the kernel.

Every `ls`, every browser tab — they’re processes in action.

Not all processes are alike. In Linux you’ll meet:  
⚡ Interactive — launched by you  
🛠️ Batch — scheduled jobs  
👻 Daemons — background services  
🔗 Threads — lightweight workers  
⚙️ Kernel threads — system’s own tasks

Each with its own job in the system orchestra 🎶

Linux processes aren’t static — they live & move:  
✅ Running — on CPU or queued  
✅ Waiting — paused for input  
☠️ Zombie — finished, not yet reaped

Schedulers decide _who gets CPU time_, keeping the system fair & fast.
