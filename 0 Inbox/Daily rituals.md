1. First thing in the morning, as soon as you wake up, read this Alchemy of self journal from start to finish.  Remind yourself of what you want to achieve with your life, who you are becoming and the legacy you have already started to leave.  You are powerful beyond measure.   
    
2. When you look at your vision board and your goals for the future read them out loud to yourself and then imagine you having already achieved your goals and your vision, make the image in your mind detailed and colorful, experience the vision fully and let the positive emotions run through your body again and again.  This is stacking rocks.   
    
3. Read your affirmations out loud to yourself and then imagine a situation where you achieved your affirmation and make that vision detailed and colorful.  Feel the positive emotions associated with that affirmation run through your body again and again.  Stack those rocks and program your mind the way you want it to be programmed.     
    
4. Listen to your affirmations audio recording while resting on a comfy couch.  As you hear yourself state each affirmation imagine a situation where you used this and make the picture colorful and detailed.  Let the positive emotions run through your body.  Stack those rocks and drum the new programming in.   
    
5. Pull out your Alchemy Planner and plan your day.  State what you’re grateful for, what would make today great, your current projects and plan out your entire day from start to finish.  Set intention for the day.  
    
6. Take massive violent action all day long.  Execute your day just the way you planned it.  Be relentless and look fear and procrastination dead on in the eyes.  Make your character dance and feel no pain.  Do the work.   
    
7. At night time when you’re lying in bed complete this process over again and fall asleep with your affirmations playing into your ears.  Program your mind the way you want it to be programmed.  When you wake up in the morning repeat this process again and again.  The only way you can possibly not get what you want in life is to not do this process.
