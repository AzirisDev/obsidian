Scheduler decides which process should run/stop and distribute them into queues.

Queue:
- running queue
- wait queue
(if computer has several cpu cores, we also have several queues)

States:
- running - it is either running or waiting to be executed
- waiting - it is in wait queue; waiting for user input
- zombie - this process is ended, but not deleted yet
