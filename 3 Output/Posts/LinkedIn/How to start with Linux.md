When you start learning Linux, the biggest mistake is choosing comfort over clarity. 

If you jump straight into zsh and Neovim, you risk missing the fundamentals that actually build mastery. 

Here is a practical way to begin: 
✅ Use bash as your default shell to truly understand scripting. 
✅ Stick with vim as your editor, and you will become OS-tolerant thanks to universal vim motions. 
✅ Master UNIX commands like find, pipes, redirects, STDIN and STDOUT. 
✅ Explore the file system deeply instead of hiding behind shortcuts. 
✅ Keep VS Code as a backup, but not your primary tool. 

Start with the “why” before fixing the “what”. 

And if you are wondering which distribution to use, just grab Ubuntu. Reliable, stable, beginner-friendly.
