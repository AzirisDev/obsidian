**Tweet 1 (Hook):**  
When you start learning Linux, the biggest mistake is choosing comfort over clarity. 🐧  
If you jump straight into zsh and Neovim, you risk skipping the fundamentals.

🧵 Here’s a practical roadmap for beginners:

---

**Tweet 2:**  
✅ Start with **bash** as your default shell.  
You’ll truly understand scripting instead of hiding behind plugins and shortcuts.

---

**Tweet 3:**  
✅ Stick with **vim** as your editor.  
Universal motions make you OS-tolerant—you can survive on any system.

---

**Tweet 4:**  
✅ Master UNIX basics:

- `find`
    
- pipes `|`
    
- redirects `>` and `>>`
    
- STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR
    

These tools are your real superpowers. ⚡️

**Tweet 5:**  
✅ Explore the **file system deeply**.  
Don’t hide behind shortcuts—navigate, inspect, and _feel_ how Linux works.

---

**Tweet 6:**  
✅ Keep **VS Code** as a backup, but don’t rely on it.  
The goal is to be productive even on a bare server.

---

**Tweet 7 (Closing):**  
If you’re unsure about distributions → just grab **Ubuntu**.  
It’s reliable, stable, and beginner-friendly.

Start with the _why_, then master the _what_.
